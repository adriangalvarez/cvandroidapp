# cvandroidapp
Android app showing a lorem ipsum resume.  You just need to change the corresponding values at res/values/strings.xml to show real data.

It shows a Navigation Drawer, fragments passing around data to parent activity, a fancy profile fragment that shows a pic that disappears with a 
smooth animation when scrolled upwards, some hide/show layouts to show titles and only details when user wants to, a stepper to show
different screens when swiping left and right, CardViews, NestedScrollViews, nice ProgressBars with rounded corners and different colors,
rounded buttons, all with new androidx library (not using appCompat v4 nor v7).
